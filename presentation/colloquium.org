#+BEGIN_NOTES
Thank you very much for this nice introduction.

I'd also like to welcome everybody to my PhD presentation.

The topic of today is gravitational lensing and I hope that I manage
to report everything interesting which I have learned over the past
four years studying these objects.

Now, before we dive into this topic, we have to talked about two
physical prinicples which make up the phenonmenon of gravitational
lensing.

Namely, Light and Gravity.  So.... let's start with Light.

If I had a physical audience present, I would see them at a delay of
about 10 ns, if I'd be standing at a Corona-save distance from them.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Today, we have telescopes so powerful that we are able to see galaxies
whose light has been travelling for almost the entire age of the
Universe to reach us.

We observe them in a Universe which is still quite young where matter,
mainly gas, is not quite cool enough yet so that gravity has had time
to pull them together and form many stars. 

The shapes of these galaxies are therefore quite different from what
we observe in our neighborhood the Local group.

:END:

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now, I want to stress that we are not in the center of our Universe,
but we perceive it in concentric spheres of cosmic time (like
geological strata) reaching back to the very beginning.

There, we can observe parts of the Universe which are so far back,
they appear to be still in the final stages of the Big Bang when
space was completely filled with an opaque, dense, and extremely hot
plasma. The light that we observe from there, we call the Cosmic
Microwave Background.

As light reaches us from afar, we observe the Universe in different
eras where its components, i.e. galaxies and all invisible parts, are
in different evolutionary stages.

We are surrounded by these epochs and receive their light from all
directions.

And sometimes we observe objects which appear to come from
different directions simultaneously... that's what we call
gravitational lensing.
#+END_NOTES


* Gravity
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The second part to understanding what gravitational lensing is, is
gravity. 

In highschool, you learned about Newton's law of gravity...  

and it is important, because it can explain gravitatonal interactions
on Earth and even the movements of the outer planets in our solar
system.

However, there is an anomaly with measurements of Mercuries orbit
which scientists were unable to explain with Newton's law.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Until 1915, when Albert Einstein published this very important
equation.

It's an equation which relates mass + energy (T on the right), to
gravity and the curvature of spacetime (the Rs on the left).

Now, it is not important that you know what this equation exactly
means, just know that this equation remains to this day the best
description of how gravity works.

When Einstein deviced this equation it passed all his initial tests.

It matched Newton's law where it needed to, and managed to explain the anomalies of Mercury's orbit exactly. 

It also made several predictions, about how light propagates through
the structure of the Universe.

And very important for today's talk, it predicted how the path of
light is bent when travelling through a gravitational potential.
This effect is what we call gravitational lensing.

And as a sidenote, this equation is also compatible with the expansion
of the Universe, even though Einstein tried his best for a long time
to ignore it.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
It didn't take long until this theory of Einstein's passed its first
test.

In 1919, Eddington, Dyson, and Davidson travelled to two places,
Principe, an island off the coast of West-Africa and Sobral in Brazil,
and simulatenously measured stellar constellations during a solar
eclipse. And measured the deflection by comparing to their original positions.

This is only possible during an eclipse because otherwise the light
from the Sun would obscure any other light source.

After their findings were published, newspapers all over the world
reported about it. The NY Times headlines are in my opinion especially
amusing: "..."

* Gravitational lensing

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Gravitational lensing is, as I mentioned just before, the deflection
of light by a gravitational field from a massive object.

In my opinion, a visual demonstration is far better than any other
form of explanation.

However, since the gravitational aspect of lensing is hard to
reproduce at home, the optical analogue is usually used for such
demonstrations.

And here you see one example, using the stem of a wine glass...

Here you see the beautifully illuminated town of Zurich at night with
the üetliberg in the background.

If I move the cursor... it shows a lensed field.

What is important to know about gravitational lenses, is that the mass
distribution of a lens, meaning whether light from a source passes by
a black hole, a star, a galaxy, or even heavier objects, will
determine how much the light is deflected and what configuration is
ultimately observed.

For the experts in the room: the deflections in these mock-ups roughly
correspond to an singular isothermal sphere model.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Okay, now everybody should know what I'm roughly talking about during
the rest of the talk.

Richard Feynman once said, "Yesterday's discovery is today's
calibration... and tomorrow's background!"

Gravitational lensing is a research field which has a hand in all of
those points.

We constantly discover new gravitational lenses... currently there are
roughly 800 confirmed lenses, but within the next 10 years we expect
this number to be more like 100'000.

So, we also need to configure and calibrate and optimize our modelling
techniques to be able to efficiently handle so many lenses.

And in some cases lenses are also the background information used to
infer other astrophysical or cosmological properties.

My research during the past 4 year can be summarized with the latter two points in this
quote and is schematically shown in this graph...

The goal of every lens study is to make connections from observations
to theory.

This is usually accomplished by modelling the observed lensing galaxy.
And this has been done many times before...

Some go even further and test their models against simulations of
galaxies.

However, so far to my knowledge nobody has made a direct connection
from simulations to observed lensing galaxies.

In the end I will show you how one could go about this at the end of the talk.  

But let's first talk about the expansion rate of the Universe, the
Hubble constant.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A gravitational lens system consists of 3 aligned parts.
1) A bright source that sends out light which is deflected by...
2) A foreground object, usually a galaxy, and focussed towards...
3) The observer

In this illustration most interesting part is the source, which is a
quasar, or AGN, which is a very bright, an accreting black-hole.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The interesting thing about quasars is that their brightness seems to
fluctuate.  This is interesting because in gravitational lenses light
rays take different paths around the lens and consequently have
different travel times.

The difference between these travel times are called time delays which
are measureable and are proportional to the Hubble constant.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Why is it even interesting today to measure the Hubble constant?

In 1929 Hubble discovered that galaxies are receding from us and that
this recession seems to be proportional to their distance.

By measuring these distances, he came to the conclusion that this must
be because the Universe is expanding.  And you can even read the value
for this recession rate of in his plot... it's about 500 km/s / Mpc.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
And in fact, the most recent measurements are between roughly 65
and 80.  Now I don't have time to discuss every single measurement,
but maybe just remember the Planck measurement which seems to be the most
precise one yet, and the SHOES measurement from the Late type branch.

These different methods seem to disagree with each other, if you
compare their error bars.

With the CCHP being the most inbetween measurement.

Now, this tension between different methods of obtaining the Hubble
constant, is why it is important to look for more independent
measurements in the hope to resolve this conflict.

I have tried myself at this problem and assembled a set of 8 lenses
with known time-delays between their different images.

This way of measuring the Hubble constant is a first order measurement
and that's why also have to supply the time delays which lens model.

We have used the positions of these quasar images, and used them to
fit lens models to the observations.

We did that with a lens modelling technique called free-form
modelling, which Prasenjit and Liliya sort of pioneered.

They are called free-form because each mass pixel that you can see
here is fit with a Monte-Carlo approach and therefore is not

constaints were used in the modelling process which means the
ensemble-average is a solution to the lens observation as well.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
By combining the mass models with the time-delays we obtain values for
the Hubble constant.  And because, we have explored the degenerate
solution space, we have not just one value, but a distribution of a
1000 values.

Now, you can see that the spread of this distribution is quite wide,
in fact it contains values from 60 all the way to 80 km/s/Mpc.
With the median written out here.

And in comparison with other measurements, we seem to be in the same
ball park as other types of measurements.

I also want to draw your attention to the units I have used here on
the bottom axis.

In my opinion, km/s/Mpc is hard to say and also not in SI units.  When
using these legacy units, one implicitly says something about the way
how the Hubble constant is measured. And since other types of
measurements which do not measure a velocity gradient, They really
have no reason to use these old units. And in my humble opinion,
should use units like attoHertz.

Another form of the Hubble constant is the critical density.  If the
Universe is roughly isotropic (which tests indicated), and the
curvature of the Universe is flat (which we also think is the case),
the critical density is the average density of the Universe.

And this is sort of what the Planck survey actually measures.  So it
makes more physical sense to compare critical density values to this
type of measureement.

And we obtained a value which is equivalent to about 5 protons per
cubic meter.

Now, we didn't stop there we also checked whether our models actually
are good fits to the entire images and not just the quasar images.

This was not always the case, but as soon as we filtered out the bad models.
We had quite good agreements with the observations.

I will now switch between the fitted images and the observational
data, always indicated by the underlined part in the title and let you

#+BEGIN_NOTES
By filtering out the bad synthetic fits to the observations, we
effectively change the distribution of H0 values.

However, you see that the change is not much that the distribution
more or less remains unchanged.

Which is an indication that no matter how well we fit the imaged data,
there are intrisic degeneracies remaining, which are hard suppress.

And so far, with any H0 result from lensing I would not be comfortable
to claim less than 5% precisions without a proper exploration of the
degeneracies.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
As I said before, different mass maps can produce very similar image
configuration... as you see here.  Each synthetic image is produced by
the mass model underneath it.

Now, there are slight differences in the images, which suggests that
we can opitimze our lens model ensembles, by only keeping the mass
maps with the best-fitting synthetics.

But even then, some degeneracies remain and we have to find ways to
identify and compare these degenerate models.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
And therefore we perfomed some tests with simulated lenses and
investigated the degeneracies in detail.

Here, you see the description for the so-called arrival time surface,
which encompasses the modelled mass distribution $\kappa$ and true
source position $\beta$.

It is not something we can observe everywhere, but the extremal points
of this surface is where we can detect images in observations.

The most severe case of lensing degeneracy is called the steepness or
mass-sheet degeneracy.
It effectively rescales the entire arrival-times surface.

In order to compare different mass maps it's convenient to ignore the
source position and look at an arrival-time surface with $\beta = 0$.

We labelled it the lensing Roche potential due to it's similarity to
the Roche potential in binary systems.

The mass-sheet degeneracy also simply rescales the Roche potential and
therefore different mass models can be compared by comparing their
lensing Roche potentials, by calculating their normalized inner
product.

This effectively ignores the mass-sheet degeneracy and compares their
shapes independent of their steepness.

The Roche potential can also be used to calculate the synthetic
images, since the gradient of the Roche potential is the source
position.

By fitting this complicated equation with the data, which in the ideal
case is $I(\theta)$, we can produce synthetic images and reconstruct
the source behind the lens.  You see an example, here the synthetic
and the source here...

All this is implemented in a code I developed... gleam which is
available on github.

* Lens matching

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now, gleam gave us the idea that maybe there is not even need to model
a galaxy in order to explain the observations.

There are so many galaxy formation simulations which produce galaxies
which are far superior models compared to lens models.

This gave us the idea of what we called the lens matching technique.

  P(F\,|\,D) &= \frac{P(D\,|\,F) \; P(F)}{P(D)} \\
  & \\
  P(D\,|\,F) &= \sum_g P(D\,|\,g) \; P(g\,|\,F) \\

\end{align}

Galaxy-formation scenario: $F$, observed data: $D$, galaxy properties: $g$ nuisance paramters: $\nu$

#+ATTR_HTML: :class slide-footer
Denzel et al. (2020c, submitted to MNRAS)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The concept is the following...

Ideally, one would like to compare lensing observations with galaxy
simulations implementing various galaxy formation scenarios.

In Bayesian terms, the posterior probability distribution of a
particular galaxy formation scenario F compared with the data, is
given by the likelihood of the data given a galaxy formation scenario
times the prior probability of a galaxy formation scenario and
normalized by the data marginalized over all possible galaxy formation
scenarios.

Of course this is hard to calculate, but in a comparison of two galaxy
formation scenarios, these terms cancel.

The term of interest is the likelihood P(D|F).
This is given by this marginalization over all galaxy properties g.

Now, since galaxy formation is very complex and involves many
different components and parameters, there will be some nuisance
parameters we are not interested in. So the likelihood of a particular
galaxy property is given by the marginalization over some nuisance
paramters.

Conventional lens modelling consists of constructing g such that
P(D|g) is optimized.
