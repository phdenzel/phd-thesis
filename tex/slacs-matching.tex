% Abstract
\section*{Abstract}
\noindent The study of strong-lensing systems conventionally involves
constructing a mass distribution that can reproduce the observed
multiply-imaging properties.  Such mass reconstructions are
generically non-unique.  Here we present an alternative strategy:
instead of modelling the mass distribution, we search cosmological
galaxy-formation simulations for plausible matches.  In this paper we
test the idea on seven well-studied lenses from the SLACS survey.  For
each of these, we first pre-select a few hundred galaxies from the
EAGLE simulations, using the expected Einstein radius as an initial
criterion.  Then, for each of these pre-selected galaxies, we fit for
the source light distribution, while using MCMC for the placement and
orientation of the lensing galaxy, so as to reproduce the multiple
images and arcs.  The results indicate that the strategy is feasible,
and even yields relative posterior probabilities of two different
galaxy-formation scenarios, though these are not statistically
significant yet.  Extension to other observables, such as kinematics
and colours of the stellar population in the lensing galaxy, is
straightforward in principle, though we have not attempted it yet.
Scaling to arbitrarily large numbers of lenses also appears feasible.
This will be especially relevant for upcoming wide-field surveys,
through which the number of galaxy lenses will rise possibly a
hundredfold, which will overwhelm conventional modelling methods.
