% Abstract
\section*{Abstract}
\noindent Fossil groups are usually thought to be the end product of natural
galaxy group evolution in which group members sink towards the center of the
gravitational potential due to dynamical friction, and finally merge into a
single, massive, and (x-ray) bright elliptical.
Since gravitational lensing depends on the mass of a foreground
object, its mass concentration, and distance to the observer, we can expect
lensing effects of such fossil groups to be particularly strong.

\noindent In this paper, we present lens models for the curious case of
J143454.4$+$522850, labelled SW05 by the \SW~discovery service, which
ultimately led to the discovery of a potential fossil group candidate.
We employ stellar population synthesis models to obtain precise
light-to-stellar mass estimates from the photometric data.
Combining these stellar mass models with the lensing models allows us to
separate the total mass of the lens into the two most prominent components in
galaxies, stars and dark matter, thereby producing high-resolution dark matter
maps for the lens.
The observed enclosed mass profiles are compared with state-of-the-art galaxy
formation simulations, which shows interesting differences between observation
and simulations.
These differences, as well as the lens model on itself, finally lead us to the
conclusion that SW05 might indeed be a fossil group candidate.
It would represent the first direct comparison of a fossil groups' dark matter
halo with its stellar component in the center.
We finally put forth the idea of a diagnostic for the identification of fossil
groups through gravitational lensing by looking for the lack of features in the
lens models.
