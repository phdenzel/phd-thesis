Like most fundamental theories in physics which helped in the present-time
understanding of our Universe and the interactions within, general relativity
was formulated in the early 20th century.  While the word was spreading of
Einstein's construct of the supposedly static Universe which involved a "cosmic
constant" to keep it so, Vesto Melvin Slipher and Edwin Hubble performed the key
measurements which provided the connection between theory and observations. By
1923, Slipher's hard work yielded a compilation of velocity estimates for 41
galaxies. Interestingly, most of those galaxies were receding from us.  Half a
decade afterwards, Edwin Hubble investigated the relation between his distance
measurements to the radial velocities of these galaxies, and realized something
which could arguably be called the birth of modern cosmology, the universe was
expanding~\sidecite{Kirshner04, Hubble29}\marginnote[2cm]{While one would expect
such a finding to be highly cited, Hubble's publication currently counts 72
officially citations.}.
