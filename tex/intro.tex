On May 29, 1919 during a total solar eclipse, three scientists, Eddington,
Dyson, and Davidson, tried to find out what effect, if any, is produced by a
gravitational field on the path of a light ray traversing
it~\cite{Eddington1920}.  During a thoroughly prepared expedition, they measured
the deflection of positions of stars in the previously studied Hyades cluster
caused by the mass of the Sun as predicted by the theory of gravity, general
relativity.  This was the first observation of gravitational lensing, as well as
the first predicted and validated effect of general
relativity~\sidecite{Einstein1911}.

Effectively, gravitational lensing is entirely analogous to optical lenses. In
fact, to produce the distorted light signatures like they are observed in
gravitational lens systems, one only needs a stem from a wine glass and move it
in front of a light source.  A toy example of such a situation can be found
under:
\href{https://phdenzel.github.io/zurich-lens/}{phdenzel.github.io/zurich-lens/}.
In optics, the lens comprises a glass sheet of variable thickness.  It deflects
light by an amount proportional to the local thickness.  The physical process
which causes a change of direction when a ray traverses a glass lens, is called
refraction.  It describes the delay, i.e. decrease in speed of light, due to the
change of media and therefore a change in direction.  While the result of
lensing is the same for both optical and gravitational lenses, the latter causes
the delay and deflection due to the change of the felt gravitational potential
as light moves through it.  The rather rare occurrence of a perfect alignment of
a background source, e.~g. a quasar, and a massive foreground object in which
the imaged source is distorted in a way such that it can be observed multiple
times or even as a ring wrapping around the lens, is called \textit{strong}
gravitational lensing.  \figref{mock-lens} demonstrates such a case with a
mock lens.

    hole with a third of the Sun's mass would replace the Moon in front of M82.

More specifically, the deflection in gravitational lensing is of the order of
$4M/R$, where $M$ is the mass of the lens and $R$ its size.  Strong
gravitational lensing occurs when the apparent size $R/D$ of the aligned lens at
a distance $D$ is comparable to that deflection.  In fact, although the
underlying physical process is all the same, gravitational lensing is
categorized into three types based on the observational techniques and mass or
size regimes: \textit{strong}, \textit{weak}, and \textit{micro} lensing.
\begin{align}
    \text{strong} \hspace{1cm}&\frac{4M}{R} \gtrsim \frac{R}{D}\\
    \text{weak} \hspace{1cm}&\frac{4M}{R} < \frac{R}{D}\\
    \text{micro} \hspace{1cm}&\frac{4M}{R} \gg \frac{R}{D}
\end{align}
