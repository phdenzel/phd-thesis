% Abstract
\section*{Abstract}

  \noindent 
  We present a determination of the Hubble constant from the joint, free-form
  analysis of 8 strongly, quadruply lensing systems.  
  In the concordance cosmology, we find $\Ho{} = \Hres{}$ with a precision of
  $4.97\%$.  This is in agreement with the latest measurements from Supernovae
  Type Ia and Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background.  
  Our precision is lower compared to these and other recent time-delay
  cosmography determinations, because our modelling strategies reflect the
  systematic uncertainties of lensing degeneracies.  We furthermore are able to
  find reasonable lensed image reconstructions by constraining to either value
  of $\Ho$ from local and early Universe measurements.  This leads us to
  conclude that current lensing constraints on $\Ho$ are not strong enough to
  break the ``Hubble tension'' problem of cosmology.
