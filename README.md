# phd-thesis

The thesis by Philipp Denzel using a custom LaTeX class.


## Acknowledgements

The phdbyphd class is majorly based on the [kaobook-LaTeX class](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook). 


## Design

The striking features of the class are as follows.

* Narrow single-column pages with enough space for captions and side notes.
* Every chapter starts with a content table.
* Appropriately sized figures and tables.
* Powered by KOMA-Script.


## Usage

To build the thesis simply use `make`.

The LaTeX class is exemplified by the thesis of Philipp Denzel
itself. The repository also includes a `template.tex` which can be
used to start another project.
